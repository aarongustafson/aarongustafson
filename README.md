# Hi there üëã

<p>My name is Aaron Gustafson and I work on the web.</p>

<p>I am a long-time web developer in charge of running Microsoft‚Äôs $25m AI for Accessibility grant program. Prior to leading this efforts, I was a web standards &amp; accessibility advocate on the Edge browser team.</p>

<p>When not wearing my Microsoft badge, I help organizations elegantly tackle the challenges presented by all the crazy devices and screens you see everywhere using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement">progressive enhancement</a> via <a href="http://easy-designs.net">Easy Designs</a> and <a href="https://rosenfeldmedia.com/training/">Rosenfeld Media</a>.
